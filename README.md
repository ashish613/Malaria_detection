Used deep learning model to predict the images as infected or uninfected<br/>
After trying all the models i chose vgg19 for better accuracy.<br/>
I also build a CNN model from scratch but it was unable to give more accuracy than other transfer learning technique.<br/>
resnet50 is also giving less accuracy as compared to vgg19.<br/>
vgg19 architecture is as follows -
